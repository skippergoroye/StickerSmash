The objective of this tutorial is to get started with Expo and become familiar with the Expo SDK. It'll cover the following topics:

Create an Expo App
Break down the app layout and implement it with flexbox
Use each platform's system UI to select an image from the media library
Create a sticker modal using the <Modal> and <FlatList> components from React Native
Add touch gestures to interact with a sticker
Use third-party libraries to capture a screenshot and save it to the disk
Handle platform differences between Android, iOS, and web
Finally, go through the process of configuring a status bar, a splash screen, and an icon to complete the app
